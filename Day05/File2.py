"""Writer of my symphony
Play with me
Look into my eyes and see
People walk away but never say goodbye
Someone stole the moon tonight
Took my light
Everything is black and white
Who's the fool who told you boys don't cry?
Hours and hours, empowers
Life is no game, but it's ours
While the time goes wild
Every day, I'm losin' my mind
Holdin' on in this mysterious ride
Dancin' in the storm, I got nothin' to hide
Take it all and leave the world behind
Baby, promise me you'll hold me again
I'm still broken from this hurricane
This hurricane
Livin' in a fantasy
Ecstasy
Everything is meant to be
We shall pass, but love will never die, mm
Hours and hours, empowers
Life is no game, but it's ours
While the time goes wild
Every day, I'm losin' my mind
Holdin' on in this mysterious ride
Dancin' in the storm, I got nothin' to hide
Take it all and leave the world behind
Baby, promise me you'll hold me again
I'm still broken from this hurricane
This hurricane"""
